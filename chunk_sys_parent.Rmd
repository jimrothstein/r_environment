### sys.parent() works opposite direction to nframe
```{r sys_parent}

# file <- "chunk_sys_parent.Rmd "

## sys.parent() is helper function, by itself is not very useful.

## RECALL: frame number0 is global and increase by +1 for each level down.

# ‘sys.parent’ returns the
#      number of the parent frame if ‘n’ is
#      1 (the default), the grandparent if
#      ‘n’ is 2, and so on.  

## INPUT:  n, which means number frames to go BACK.
##          o is current , 1 would be parent, 2 grandparent

## RETURNS: int, representing that frame 

sys.parent(n = 0)
sys.parent(n = 1)

f  <- function(n=NULL) {
  sys.parent(n)
}

f(0)
f(1)
f(2)


# To get environment of ancestor frame

# n=1 is parent, n=2 grandparetn
g  <- function(n=NULL) {
  sys.frame(sys.parent(n))}

g(n = 0)  # current env
g(1)      # parent env

```


```{r h}
## Return Env
h  <- function(n = NULL){
    g(n)
}
h(n=0)   # inner most
h(n=1)   # up 1 frame (parent)
h(n=2)   # up 2 frames (grandparent) 
```
